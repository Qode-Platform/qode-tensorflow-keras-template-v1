# Built by .github/workflows/deploy.yml (context ., file Dockerfile) and pushed
# to Artifact Registry. Adapted from the fleet's python stack pack.
#
# Deviations from the pack, and why:
#   - CMD runs the job, not a server: this template has no HTTP surface, so the
#     image is a runnable job image. It will never satisfy a $PORT health check.
#   - NOTE: the tensorflow wheel is ~600MB; this image is large and slow to build.
